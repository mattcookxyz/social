# Social
A minimal social network built on Flask, Python3, and my own responsive grid system, Rudiment.css.
This project features comprehensive use of the Flask framework, secure authentication with password hashing/salt, and SQLite database setup with PeeWee ORM. A user is able to login to a secure session, create a profile, and edit their profile (only if authenticated).
